    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients</strong>: In a large mixing bowl, whish together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This creates the perfect base for those fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients</strong>: In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. The buttermilk lends a delightful tangy flavor and helps create that sought-after fluffiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry</strong>: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and gently stir until just combined. Be cautious not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine. Let the batter rest for 5 minutes to allow the leavening agents to work their magic.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat Griddle or Pan</strong>: Heat a non-stick griddle or skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with a bit of butter or cooking spray. The key to even cooking is maintaining a consistent temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes</strong>: Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour the batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface (about 2-3 minutes), then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until golden brown on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm</strong>: Stack those golden beauties on a plate, add your favorite toppings like fresh berries, maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream, and serve immediately. The warmth of these pancakes will melt your heart!</li>
    </ol>
